# LAB04-TicTacToe

Author: Deziree Teague with Collaborators Julie Ly and Joseph Pumphrey

Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game Board that allows two players to take turns marking their position until they have three in a row (vertically, diagonally, or horizontally) or they are out of turns.  The console will congratulate the winning player by name or declare a draw.

## Usage:

* This program runs in the console
* Enter user names when prompted
* Press enter after player takes a turn to mark X/O positions
* If a player gets three in a row, the game ends with a congratulations to the winner
* If the players run out of tries, there is a draw
